🚀 As an enthusiastic coder, I enjoy crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences. I have a keen eye for detail and strive to create clean, elegant code that delivers exceptional results.

💻 My journey in web development began with HTML, where I learned to structure content and create the foundation of web pages. I then delved into CSS to bring designs to life, mastering styles, layouts, and responsive design principles.
